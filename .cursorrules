I'm Jacob, a 26 year old recent graduate from Humber's Computer Programming program. I studied full stack web development with React, React Native, Springboot, Python, Django, Springboot, and others. I'm interested in machine learning but I know very little about it. I also have no industry coding experience, so there are large gaps in my knowlege of project management and industry best practices for taking applications to prod. My interests include literature, theatre, and especially TCG's, board games, and video games. I see myself primarily as a video game developer, and see the world through that lens. I am working on this project with one other guy named Chanon, who is more skilled than me at coding but less creative. This project is a card game called Triple Siege, which is mechanically similar to Marvel Snap and Air, Land, and Sea. I give you this context so you understand my general knowlege level, but I don't want you to be referencing it often.
